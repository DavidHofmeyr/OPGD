Title: Optimal Projections for Gaussian Discriminants
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David P. Hofmeyr [aut, cre] and Francois Kamper [aut]

Description: Obtains optimal projections for the purpose of class discrimination under the assumption of Gaussian class densities, with the function OPGD.
  The method uses the full classification likelihood during optimisation to improve over existing methods based on a simpler proxy.
  In addition, clustering with projected Gaussian Mixture Models is also implemented in the function OPGDcluster.
